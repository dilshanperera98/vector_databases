# vector_databases

A vector database is a type of database designed to store and query vector embeddings efficiently. Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data, such as text, images, or other types of information, transformed into a high-dimensional space by an embedding model. These databases are particularly useful for tasks involving similarity search, clustering, and other operations on high-dimensional data.
